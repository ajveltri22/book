============
The Handbook
============

**Welcome!**

This handbook is a living resource about why and -- more importantly -- *how* to
use DataLad. It aims to provide novices and advanced users of all backgrounds
with both the basics of DataLad and start-to-end use cases of specific
applications. If you want to get hands-on experience and learn DataLad, the *Basics*
part of this book will teach you. If you want to know what is possible, the
*use cases* will show you. And if you want to help others to get started with DataLad,
the `companion repository <https://github.com/datalad-handbook/course>`_ provides
`free and open source teaching material <teaching.html>`_ tailored to the handbook.

Before you read on, please note that the handbook is based on **DataLad version 0.12**,
but the section :ref:`install` will set you up with what you need if you currently do
not have DataLad 0.12 or higher installed.

If you're new here, please start the handbook `here <intro/philosophy.html>`_.
Alternatively, try to identify with one of several user-types in this
`user specific guide to the handbook <intro/user_types.html>`_.

   **PLEASE NOTE:** This is an archived version of the DataLad handbook
   If you would be willing to provide feedback on its contents, please

   This handbook version is **not** a complete documentation of all
   functionality in DataLad 0.13, but the state the handbook was in at this
   time. Find the latest released version of the handbook at
   `handbook.datalad.org/en/stable <http://handbook.datalad.org/en/stable/>`_,
